# Weather App

Basic Weather App that fetches data from an API and displays it. The app works for Celcius and Fahrenheit degrees. It shows the local time of the place you searched for, and the city. It also contains buttons for your most recent searches, and changes background depending on the time you searched (day vs night)

It only contains one global variable too.

I did this as part of the Odin Project curriculum.
