# Weather App

Basic Weather App that fetches data from and API and displays it. The app works for Celcius and Farenheit degrees. It shows the local time of the place you searched for, and the city. It also contains buttons for your most recent searches

I did this as part of the Odin Project curriculum.

### Demo
